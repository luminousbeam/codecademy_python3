# 1. Large Power
# Create a function named large_power() that takes two parameters named base and exponent.

# If base raised to the exponent is greater than 5000, return True, otherwise return False

def large_power(base, exponent):
  if base ** exponent > 5000:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your large_power function:
print(large_power(2, 13))
# should print True
print(large_power(2, 12))
# should print False

# 2. Over Budget
# Create a function called over_budget that has five parameters named budget, food_bill, electricity_bill, internet_bill, and rent.

# The function should return True if budget is less than the sum of the other four parameters — you’ve gone over budget! Return False otherwise.

def over_budget(budget, food_bill, electricity_bill, internet_bill, rent):
  if budget < (food_bill + electricity_bill + internet_bill + rent):
    return True
  else:

# should print False
print(over_budget(80, 20, 30, 10, 30))
# should print True

# 3. Twice As Large
# Create a function named twice_as_large() that has two parameters named num1 and num2.

# Return True if num1 is more than double num2. Return False otherwise.

# 4. Divisible By Ten
# Create a function called divisible_by_ten() that has one parameter named num.

# The function should return True if num is divisible by 10, and False otherwise. Consider using modulo (%) to check for divisibility.

def divisible_by_ten(num):
  if num % 10 == 0:
    return True
  else: 
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your divisible_by_ten function:
print(divisible_by_ten(20))
# should print True
print(divisible_by_ten(25))
# should print False

# 5. Not Equal
# Create a function named not_sum_to_ten() that has two parameters named num1 and num2.

# Return True if num1 and num2 do not sum to 10. Return False otherwise.

def not_sum_to_ten(num1, num2):
  if num1 + num2 !=10:
    return True
  else:

# Uncomment these function calls to test your not_sum_to_ten function:
print(not_sum_to_ten(9, -1))
# should print True
print(not_sum_to_ten(9, 1))
# should print False
print(not_sum_to_ten(5,5))
# should print False

# Advanced Python Challenges

# 1. In Range
# Create a function named in_range() that has three parameters named num, lower, and upper.

# The function should return True if num is greater than or equal to lower and less than or equal to upper. Otherwise, return False.

def in_range(num, lower, upper):
  if num >= lower and num <= upper:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your in_range function:
print(in_range(10, 10, 10))
# should print True
print(in_range(5, 10, 20))
# should print False

# 2. Same Name
# Create a function named same_name() that has two parameters named your_name and my_name.

# If our names are identical, return True. Otherwise, return False.

def same_name(your_name, my_name):
  if your_name == my_name:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your same_name function:
print(same_name("Colby", "Colby"))
# should print True
print(same_name("Tina", "Amber"))
# should print False

# 3. Always False
# Create a function named always_false() that has one parameter named num.

# Using an if statement, your variable num, and the operators >, and <, make it so your function will return False no matter what number is stored in num.

# An if statement that is always false is called a contradiction. You will rarely want to do this while programming, but it is important to realize it is possible to do this.

def always_false(num):
  if num > 0 or num < 1:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your always_false function:
print(always_false(0))
# should print False
print(always_false(-1))
# should print False
print(always_false(1))
# should print False

# 4. Movie Review
# Create a function named movie_review() that has one parameter named rating.

# If rating is less than or equal to 5, return "Avoid at all costs!". If rating is between 5 and 9, return "This one was fun.". If rating is 9 or above, return "Outstanding!"

def movie_review(rating):
  if rating <= 5:
    return "Avoid at all costs!"
  elif rating >= 5 and rating < 9:
    return "This one was fun."
  elif rating >= 9:
    return "Outstanding!"
# Uncomment these function calls to test your movie_review function:
print(movie_review(9))
# should print "Outstanding!"
print(movie_review(4))
# should print "Avoid at all costs!"
print(movie_review(6))
# should print "This one was fun."

# 5. Max Number
# Create a function called max_num() that has three parameters named num1, num2, and num3.

# The function should return the largest of these three numbers. If any of two numbers tie as the largest, you should return "It's a tie!".

def max_num(num1, num2, num3):
  if num1 > num2 and num1 > num3:
    return num1
  elif num2 > num1 and num2 > num3:
    return num2
  elif num3 > num1 and num3 > num2:
    return num3
  else:
    return "It's a tie!"
# Uncomment these function calls to test your max_num function:
print(max_num(-10, 0, 10))
# should print 10
print(max_num(-10, 5, -30))
# should print 5
print(max_num(-5, -10, -10))
# should print -5
print(max_num(2, 3, 3))
# should print "It's a tie!"
