# 1. Tenth Power
# Write a function named tenth_power() that has one parameter named num.

# The function should return num raised to the 10th power.

def tenth_power(num):
  return num ** 10

print(tenth_power(1))
# 1 to the 10th power is 1
print(tenth_power(0))
# 0 to the 10th power is 0
print(tenth_power(2))
# 2 to the 10th power is 1024

# 2. Square Root
# Write a function named square_root() that has one parameter named num.

# Use exponents (**) to return the square root of num.

def square_root(num):
  return num ** .5

print(square_root(16))
# should print 4
print(square_root(100))
# should print 10

# 3. Win Percentage
# Create a function called win_percentage() that takes two parameters named wins and losses.

# This function should return out the total percentage of games won by a team based on these two numbers.

def win_percentage(wins, losses):
  total_games = wins + losses
  return (wins/total_games) * 100

print(win_percentage(5, 5))
# should print 50
print(win_percentage(10, 0))
# should print 100

# 4. Average
# Write a function named average() that has two parameters named num1 and num2.

# The function should return the average of these two numbers.

def average(num1, num2):
  return (num1 + num2)/2
# Uncomment these function calls to test your average function:
print(average(1, 100))
# The average of 1 and 100 is 50.5
print(average(1, -1))
# The average of 1 and -1 is 0

# 5. Remainder
# Write a function named remainder() that has two parameters named num1 and num2.

# The function should return the remainder of twice num1 divided by half of num2.

def remainder(num1, num2):
  return (num1 * 2) % (num2/2)

# Uncomment these function calls to test your remainder function:
print(remainder(15, 14))
# should print 2
print(remainder(9, 6))
# should print 0

# Advanced Python Challenges

# 1. First Three Multiples
# Write a function named first_three_multiples() that has one parameter named num.

# This function should print the first three multiples of num. Then, it should return the third multiple.

# For example, first_three_multiples(7) should print 7, 14, and 21 on three different lines, and return 21.

def first_three_multiples(num):
  print(num * 1)
  print(num * 2)
  print(num * 3)
  return num * 3

# Uncomment these function calls to test your first_three_multiples function:
first_three_multiples(10)
# should print 10, 20, 30, and return 30
first_three_multiples(0)
# should print 0, 0, 0, and return 0
# 2. Tip
# Create a function called tip() that has two parameters named total and percentage.

# This function should return the amount you should tip given a total and the percentage you want to tip.

def tip(total, percentage):
    return (total * percentage) * .01
# Uncomment these function calls to test your tip function:
print(tip(10, 25))
# should print 2.5
print(tip(0, 100))
# should print 0.0

# 3. Bond, James Bond
# Write a function named introduction() that has two parameters named first_name and last_name.

# The function should return the last_name, followed by a comma, a space, first_name another space, and finally last_name.

def introduction(first_name, last_name):
  return last_name + ", " + first_name + " " + last_name
# Uncomment these function calls to test your introduction function:
print(introduction("James", "Bond"))
# should print Bond, James Bond
print(introduction("Maya", "Angelou"))
# should print Angelou, Maya Angelou

# 4. Dog Years
# Some say that every one year of a human’s life is equivalent to seven years of a dog’s life. Write a function named dog_years() that has two parameters named name and age.

# The function should compute the age in dog years and return the following string:
def dog_years(name, age):
  age = age * 7
  return f"{name}, you are {age} years old in dog years"
# Uncomment these function calls to test your dog_years function:
print(dog_years("Lola", 16))
# should print "Lola, you are 112 years old in dog years"
print(dog_years("Baby", 0))
# should print "Baby, you are 0 years old in dog years"
# "{name}, you are {age} years old in dog years"
# Test this function with your name and your age!

# 5. All Operations
# Create a function named lots_of_math(). This function should have four parameters named a, b, c, and d. The function should print 3 lines and return 1 value.

# First, print the sum of a and b.

# Second, print d subtracted from c.

# Third, print the first number printed, multiplied by the second number printed.

# Finally, return the third number printed modulo a.

def lots_of_math(a, b, c, d):
  first = a + b
  second = c - d
  third = first * second
  print(first)
  print(second)
  print(third)
  return  third % first

print(lots_of_math(1, 2, 3, 4))
# should print 3, -1, -3, 0
print(lots_of_math(1, 1, 1, 1))
# should print 2, 0, 0, 0
