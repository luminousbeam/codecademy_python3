# 1. Append Sum
# Write a function named append_sum that has one parameter — a list named named lst.

# The function should add the last two elements of lst together and append the result to lst. It should do this process three times and then return lst.

# For example, if lst started as [1, 1, 2], the final result should be [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8].

def append_sum(lst):
  for index in range(3):
    add_last_two = lst[-1] + lst[-2]
    lst.append(add_last_two)
  return lst

print(append_sum([1, 1, 2]))

# 2. Larger List
# Write a function named larger_list that has two parameters named lst1 and lst2.

# The function should return the last element of the list that contains more elements. If both lists are the same size, then return the last element of lst1.

def larger_list(lst1, lst2):
  if len(lst1) > len(lst2):
    return lst1[-1]
  elif len(lst2) > len(lst1):
    return lst2[-1]
  else:
    return lst1[-1]

print(larger_list([4, 10, 2, 5], [-10, 2, 5, 10]))

# 3. More Than N
# Create a function named more_than_n that has three parameters named lst, item, and n.

# The function should return True if item appears in the list more than n times. The function should return False otherwise.

def more_than_n(lst, item, n):
  if lst.count(item) > n:
    return True
  else:
    return False

print(more_than_n([2, 4, 6, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2], 2, 3))

# 4. Append Size
# Create a function called append_size that has one parameter named lst.

# The function should append the size of lst (inclusive) to the end of lst. The function should then return this new list.

# For example, if lst was [23, 42, 108], the function should return [23, 42, 108, 3] because the size of lst was originally 3.

def append_size(lst):
  lst.append(len(lst))
  return lst

print(append_size([23, 42, 108]))

# 5. Combine Sort
# Write a function named combine_sort that has two parameters named lst1 and lst2.

# The function should combine these two lists into one new list and sort the result. Return the new sorted list.

def combine_sort(lst1, lst2):
  new_list = lst1 + lst2
  return sorted(new_list)

print(combine_sort([4, 10, 2, 5], [-10, 2, 5, 10]))

# Advanced Python Challenges

# 1. Every Three Numbers
# Create a function called every_three_nums that has one parameter named start.

# The function should return a list of every third number between start and 100 (inclusive). For example, every_three_nums(91) should return the list [91, 94, 97, 100]. If start is greater than 100, the function should return an empty list.

def every_three_nums(start):
  my_range = range(start, 101, 3)
  empty_list = []
  if start > 100:
    return empty_list
  return list(my_range)

print(every_three_nums(91))

# 2. Remove Middle
# Create a function named remove_middle which has three parameters named lst, start, and end.

# The function should return a list where all elements in lst with an index between start and end (inclusive) have been removed.

# For example, the following code should return [4, 23, 42] because elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 have been removed:

# remove_middle([4, 8 , 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3)

def remove_middle(lst, start, end):
  del lst[start:end+1]
  return lst

print(remove_middle([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3))

# 3. More Frequent Item
# Create a function named more_frequent_item that has three parameters named lst, item1, and item2.

# Return either item1 or item2 depending on which item appears more often in lst.

# If the two items appear the same number of times, return item1.

def more_frequent_item(lst, item1, item2):
  if lst.count(item1) > lst.count(item2):
    return item1
  elif lst.count(item2) > lst.count(item1):
    return item2
  else:
    return item1

print(more_frequent_item([2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], 2, 3))

# 4. Double Index
# Create a function named double_index that has two parameters: a list named lst and a single number named index.

# The function should return a new list where all elements are the same as in lst except for the element at index. The element at index should be double the value of the element at index of the original lst.

# If index is not a valid index, the function should return the original list.

# For example, the following code should return [1,2,6,4] because the element at index 2 has been doubled:

# double_index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
# After writing your function, un-comment the call to the function that we’ve provided for you to test your results.

def double_index(lst, index):
  if index > len(lst) - 1:
    return lst
  else:
    lst[index] = lst[index]*2
    return lst

print(double_index([3, 8, -10, 12], 2))

# 5. Middle Item
# Create a function called middle_element that has one parameter named lst.

# If there are an odd number of elements in lst, the function should return the middle element. If there are an even number of elements, the function should return the average of the middle two elements.

def middle_element(lst):
  half = int(len(lst)/2)
  if len(lst) % 2 != 0:
    return lst[half]
  else:
    return int((lst[half-1] + lst[half])/2)

print(middle_element([5, 2, -10, -4, 4,5]))
